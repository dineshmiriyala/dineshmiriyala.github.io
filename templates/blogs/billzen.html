  <h1>BillZen</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">How I rebuilt invoicing for small businesses</p>

  <p>When I first started working with small businesses, one problem stood out immediately: billing. Most of the software out there was either too bloated or too complicated for real-world usage. I wanted something clean, fast, and made for people like us. That’s how <strong>BillZen</strong> began.</p>

  <div class="image-placeholder">[ Image Placeholder — Dashboard Screenshot ]</div>

  <p>The goal was simple: make invoicing effortless. With Flask as the backbone, BillZen lets users create professional invoices in seconds. Every detail, from client selection to tax breakdown, is automated and designed for speed. I wanted it to feel like part of your workflow, not another tool you have to wrestle with.</p>

  <p>As the project grew, I focused on design first. A bill shouldn’t just function, it should look beautiful when printed. Every template, font, and spacing element was tuned to give a clean, print‑ready output that feels professional, not cluttered.</p>

  <div class="image-placeholder">[ Image Placeholder — Invoice Layout Preview ]</div>

  <p>What surprised me most was how small details made the biggest difference. Persistent alerts, adjustable fonts, and even a “Paid” toggle became user favorites. And because the entire system runs locally, businesses can work without relying on the cloud, something a lot of people appreciate more than ever.</p>

  <p>BillZen isn’t just a billing tool. It’s my take on how software should work for people — simple, fast, and enjoyable to use. This project taught me that good design and utility don’t compete; they work together.</p>
